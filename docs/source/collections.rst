Collections of Chares: Arrays
=============================

.. First, a ring example. Pass a message in a ring some number of times.
.. Then transition into broadcasts, use a 2D array this time maybe.
.. Still end by all sending p2p message to main.
.. Then add reductions, so they all contribute to main instead.
